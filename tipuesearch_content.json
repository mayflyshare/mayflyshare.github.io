{"pages":[{"url":"http://mayflyshare.com/e2s-all-edit","text":"Here it is! This is a first release of my editor for electribe sample. If you are running windows, you are lucky: you can make a try. Today I just publish an executable snapshot of the editor, compiled for windows. Aesthetically, the editor is more a functional prototype than a definitive software, but it does the job. I'll publish the source code (in Python) as soon as possible (i need to clean it before). I also need to make some user documentation, but I hope the interface is enough intuitive (even if some shortcuts are not, or some could be added). Enjoy! and please send bug reports if you find some...

I'll publish soon an open source editor for e2sSample.all, supporting also import/export of .wav with metadata for the electribe sampler. I'm currently finishing to correct some identified bugs before publishing the editor.

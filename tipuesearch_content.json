{"pages":[{"url":"http://mayflyshare.com/e2s-v-0.0.5","text":"Oe2sSLE release 0.0.5 is now available. Fixes: Scroll bar view point of sample editing window is reset to top after the window is closes and re-opened. A sample with a loop start point different from then end point is not played by electribe if it is set as a 1-shot sample. Editor automatically resets the 1-shot value if loop start point of the sample is set differently of the end point. Cleaning: Some printed traces of variables have been removed. Warning messages printed by pyglet when playing sounds have been disabled.","tags":"Software","title":"Oe2sSLE release 0.0.5"},{"url":"http://mayflyshare.com/e2s-all-edit","text":"Here it is! This is a first release of my editor for electribe sample. If you are running windows, you are lucky: you can make a try. Today I just publish an executable snapshot of the editor, compiled for windows. Aesthetically, the editor is more a functional prototype than a definitive software, but it does the job. I'll publish the source code (in Python) as soon as possible (i need to clean it before). I also need to make some user documentation, but I hope the interface is enough intuitive (even if some shortcuts are not, or some could be added). Enjoy! and please send bug reports if you find some...

I'll publish soon an open source editor for e2sSample.all, supporting also import/export of .wav with metadata for the electribe sampler. I'm currently finishing to correct some identified bugs before publishing the editor.
